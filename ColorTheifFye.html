									<h2>Initial Concept</h2>
									<p>The initial idea of Color Thief Fye was actually me wanting to redo an old college game I made a called "Color Thief". However, Color Thief was group effort where as this game was worked on by solely me. The main idea was that the player is a thief that is able to change their color to bypass the security systems. That said I, this time around I wanted to add and refine some aspects of the game to make them better.</p>
									
									<h2>Contributions</h2>
									<p>Due to this project being a solo project, most of the work shown was done by me. I had worked on developing the main mechanic of having the player shift color at the press of a button. Along with that I also developed the code to check whether or not the player is coming into contact with another game object. </p>
									<p>The game object would then react to the player depending on whether or not the player is the same color as the game object. For example, if the player touches a spot light of a different color than the player's detection level decreases. </p>
									<p>I also developed a basic attack button and a dash button into the game. The attack button would turn on a hit detection box and plays an animation of the player attacking. Any enemy that touches that hit detection box would then be destroyed on contact. The dash button would have the player instantly move from one place to next like a dashing teleport.​​​​​​​</p>
